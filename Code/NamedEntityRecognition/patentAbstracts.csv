4548935,"Dihydropyridine anti-ischaemic and anti-hypertensive agents of the formula: ##STR1## and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts; wherein R is aryl or heteroaryl; R.sup.1 and R.sup.2 are each independently C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 or 2-methoxyethyl; n is 1 or 2; m is 1, 2 or 3; X is a 5 or 6 membered aromatic heterocyclic group which is linked to the adjacent alkoxymethyl group by a ring carbon atoms thereof; and Z is a group--NR.sup.3 R.sup.4 or a 5 to 6 membered nitrogen containing heterocyclic group; where R.sup.3 is H or C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl; R.sup.4 is H, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, CO(C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl), COCF.sub.3, CONR.sup.5 R.sup.6, SO.sub.2 (C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl) or a heterocyclic or SO.sub.2 -heterocyclic group, wherein the heterocyclic group is optionally substituted; R.sup.5 and R.sup.6 and each independently H or C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl or taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, they form a pyrrolidinyl, piperidyl, morpholino, piperazinyl or N-(C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl)piperazinyl group."
5747282,"The present invention relates generally to the field of human genetics. Specifically, the present invention relates to methods and materials used to isolate and detect a human breast and ovarian cancer predisposing gene (BRCA1), some mutant alleles of which cause susceptibility to cancer, in particular breast and ovarian cancer. More specifically, the invention relates to germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene and their use in the diagnosis of predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. The present invention further relates to somatic mutations in the BRCA1 gene in human breast and ovarian cancer and their use in the diagnosis and prognosis of human breast and ovarian cancer. Additionally, the invention relates to somatic mutations in the BRCA1 gene in other human cancers and their use in the diagnosis and prognosis of human cancers. The invention also relates to the therapy of human cancers which have a mutation in the BRCA1 gene, including gene therapy, protein replacement therapy and protein mimetics. The invention further relates to the screening of drugs for cancer therapy. Finally, the invention relates to the screening of the BRCA1 gene for mutations, which are useful for diagnosing the predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer."
4567178,"The invention relates to novel substituted 5,11-dihydro-6H-dibenz[b,e]azepin-6-one of the formula ##STR1## wherein A represents a (1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)-acetyl, (4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-acetyl, or [(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)-amino]-carbonyl group, and the acid addition salts thereof, which have valuable pharmacological properties, particularly an ulcer-inhibiting and secretion-inhibiting activity. The compounds of Formula I may be prepared using methods conventionally used for analogous compounds."
